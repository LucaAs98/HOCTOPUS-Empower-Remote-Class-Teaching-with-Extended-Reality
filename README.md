HOCTOPUS provides an easy tool for both teachers and students to visualize, manipulate and share 3D objects in a live-stream fashion exploiting peer-to-peer network connections. In particular, HOCTOPUS consists of two main components thought for the two main actors of our use case: teachers and students. For teachers, we provided an MR streaming experience that let the user picks the 3D model for the class she/he wants to teach and straightforward interactions to manipulate during the explanation. For students instead, we developed an AR experience to visualize the streamed 3D object in a non-situated fashion, which real-time twins all the manipulations made by the teacher in the MR experience. Students have also the possibility to interact with the object and ask questions.

In particular, we developed the MR side of the system for the Hololens 2 and the AR one for Android mobile devices.
In practice, HOCTOPUS aims at supporting remote MR class teaching by streaming the teacher's manipulations of 3D models to all the students that joined the class, to enhance and improve the learning process of complex structures and processes.
